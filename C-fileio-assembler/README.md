I created a program in C that reads an assembly language text file (.ASM) designed for PennSim and writes its machine code equivalent as a binary file (.OBJ), similar to the output of the PennSim assembler. This project required handling file I/O operations with both text and binary formats and involved developing a mini-LC4 assembler. The assembler reads each line of assembly language, parses the instructions, and translates them into machine code, creating a direct binary representation.

The program explores key C programming concepts, including string manipulation, multidimensional arrays, and advanced file handling using the Clang compiler to leverage the standard C library. This assignment showcases foundational systems programming skills by demonstrating an understanding of file-oriented operations, string parsing, and low-level data processing in C.
