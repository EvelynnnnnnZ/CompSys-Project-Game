I developed a C-to-Assembly bridge, implementing C functions that interact with Assembly subroutines through stack-based argument passing and return value handling, rather than directly using register files. The task required converting an existing subroutine, SUB_FACTORIAL, to operate via stack memory, and linking it with a main() function in C using the LCC compiler, demonstrating how C functions translate into Assembly subroutines.

In Part I, I wrapped subroutines to enable the use of Assembly TRAP routines in C, supporting I/O operations and ultimately allowing the creation of a C-based game (Snake) on the LC4 architecture. Through stack management and PennSim integration, the project emphasized debugging with stack frames and linking multiple .ASM files.

Part II of the assignment involved programming Snake, utilizing Assembly-based I/O wrappers to control in-game elements. This required function initialization, collision detection, and graphics display, all managed within C, while interacting with the Assembly wrappers developed in Part I.
