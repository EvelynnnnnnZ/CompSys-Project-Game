I developed a program that reads and parses a .OBJ file generated by PennSim and loads it into a hash table of linked lists. This hash table organizes LC4â€™s memory into four core segments: User Program Memory, User Data Memory, OS Program Memory, and OS Data Memory. Building on prior experience with parsing .OBJ files and simulating LC4, the task extends to reverse assembling, or disassembling, the binary data back into its original assembly language.

The program applies parsing techniques to interpret the .OBJ file structure, converting binary instructions into human-readable assembly code. This reverse assembly process solidifies understanding of LC4's memory segmentation and reinforces memory management techniques within the context of hash tables and linked lists.
